# 50.002 Computation Structures component for 2D hell week
<sub>This architecture largely ignores the competition due to multiple mid-terms on-going during the 2D week. Look elsewhere for best build!</sub>  
<sub>Architecture used is, below 3ns and easy to do and rather huge</sub>  
<sub>To obtain maximum score in the Computation Structure component, an adder architecture below 3ns is required.</sub>
